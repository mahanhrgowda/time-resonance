Streamlit App Overview
This app lets you enter two birth dates and times to see how their qualities and time resonance align, using the triple helix and block universe theory. It looks at when the energies of prosperity (Śrī), material grounding (Bhū), and compassion (Nīlā) might converge, showing harmony based on their closeness in the cosmic timeline.

How It Works
Input your birth date and time, and another person’s, in any time zone.
The app calculates their positions in the triple helix plot, checking how their convergence points (like your birth in 1993) align, using the Big Bang as the reference.
It then shows a score for resonance (how close in time) and harmony (how their qualities match), with visualizations like 3D plots and timelines.
Example for July 12, 1993, 12:26 PM IST
If you enter another birth, say January 1, 1993, 12:00 AM UTC, it’ll compare their Z-values (time since Big Bang) and see if their helical paths intersect closely, reflecting shared energies.
